                <p>
                    In high school, I was an avid student pursuing a career path in healthcare. Who knew that taking a grade 11 computer science class and meeting one charismatic and enthusiastic teacher would completely <b>change my life.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, I am a computer engineering student at Queen’s University pursuing a career in <b>data science with an emphasis on machine learning.</b> However, I’m also interested in full-stack and software development.
                </p>
